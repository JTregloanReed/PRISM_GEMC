# PRISM_GEMC
PRISM:- Transiting Exoplanet and Starspot Model. GEMC:-  Optimisation Algorithm for PRISM
PRISM uses a pixellation approach to represent the star and planet on a two-dimensional array in Cartesian coordinates. Six parameters are used to model the transit: the ratio between the planetary and stellar radii, the sum of the fractional radii, 7 the linear and quadratic LD coefficients, the orbital inclination, and the time of mid-transit. Then, four parameters are used to model each starspot: the longitude and colatitude of the centre of the starspot on the stellar surface, the angular size of the starspot and the starspotâ€™s contrast (the ratio between the intensity (I) of the starspot and the surrounding photosphere). For more details see (Tregloan-Reed J., Southworth J., Tappert C., 2013, MNRAS, 428, 3671, Tregloan-Reed J. et al., 2015, MNRAS, 450, 1760, Tregloan-Reed, J., Southworth, J., Mancini, L., et al. 2018, MNRAS, 474, 5485).
GEMC was created in conjunction to PRISM to improve the efficiency of finding a global solution in a complex multivariate parameter space compared to conventional MCMC algorithms (Tregloan-Reed et al. 2013, 2015). GEMC is a hybrid between an MCMC and a genetic algorithm and is based on the Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) put forward by Ter Braak (Ter Braak C. J. F., 2006, Stat. Comput., 16, 239).

The codes are written in IDL (Interactive Data Language, For further details, see http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/Productsand
Technology/Software/IDL.aspx.) and were developed to model the transit, limb darkening (LD), and starspots on the stellar disc simultaneously.
